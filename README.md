## Project Objective

The cub3D project is an educational exercise developed by 42, inspired by the classic game Wolfenstein 3D. The main objective of this project is to create a 3D first-person game using ray-casting techniques for graphic rendering. The project involves concepts of computer graphics, event handling, memory management, and performance optimization.

### Project Features

- Reading and interpreting configuration files to define the map and game elements.
- Rendering 3D environments using ray-casting.
- Player movement in a 3D environment.
- Interaction with objects and elements in the scene.
- Handling keyboard and mouse events for player control.
